# Configuration

The behavior of WebTester can be configured on a browser by browser basis
by providing a `Configuration` instance while creating the `Browser`.

A `Configuration` instance can be created by using a `ConfigurationBuilder` implementation.
That instance can then be used to customize the browser's configuration using a `BrowserBuilder`.

## BaseConfigurationBuilder
The `BaseConfigurationBuilder` will use a `BaseConfiguration` instance as a starting point.
It takes `ConfigurationAdapter` and `ConfigurationExporter` instances as options before the `build()` operation.

## ConfigurationAdapter
A `ConfigurationAdapter` is used to change properties of an existing `Configuration`.
This is done using a callback method `adapt(Configuration c)`.

The following adapters are provided by the `webtester-core` module:

- `DefaultFileConfigurationAdapter`
- `GlobalFileConfigurationAdapter`
- `LocalFileConfigurationAdapter`

**DefaultFileConfigurationAdapter**
This adapter looks up a properties file called `testit-webtester-default.properties` on the classpath's root level
and loads each contained key / value pair into the provided `Configuration` instance.

**GlobalFileConfigurationAdapter**
This adapter looks up a properties file called `testit-webtester-global.properties` on the classpath's root level
and loads each contained key / value pair into the provided `Configuration` instance.

**LocalFileConfigurationAdapter**
This adapter looks up a properties file called `testit-webtester.properties` on the classpath's root level
and loads each contained key / value pair into the provided `Configuration` instance.

## ConfigurationExporter
A `ConfigurationExporter` is used to "export" a `Configuration` to another System.
This is done by using a callback method `export(String key, Object value)` for each key / value pair of the `Configuration`.

The following exporters are provided by the `webtester-core` module:

- SystemPropertyConfigurationExporter

**SystemPropertyConfigurationExporter**
This exporter can be used to export each key / value pair as system properties in order to make them accessible using `System#getProperty(String key)`.

## Default Configuration
Since not everyone needs to customize the configuration in the context of his or her project
a 'DefaultConfigurationBuilder' is provided which uses the following adapters (in order)
and no exporters to build a Configuration :
   
- `DefaultFileConfigurationAdapter`
- `GlobalFileConfigurationAdapter`
- `LocalFileConfigurationAdapter`
   
**Note:** This builder is also used in case a `Browser` is [build](browser.md) without providing a custom `Configuration` instance.

## Example
```java
ConfigurationAdapter adapter1 = ...;
ConfigurationAdapter adapter2 = ...;
ConfigurationExporter exporter = ...;
 
// this will adapt a base configuration first with 'adapter1' and then with 'adapter2'
// after that the final configuration will be exported using the 'exporter'
Configuration config = new BaseConfigurationBuilder()
                            .withAdapters(adapter1, adapter2)
                            .withExporter(exporter)
                            .build();
```

# Default Properties
The following shows all default properties loaded by the `DefaultFileConfigurationAdapter`.
The values are the same as the fallback values of the `BaseConfiguration` implementation.

```properties
# Whether or not the events should be fired.
# TYPE: boolean [true, false]
events.enabled = true

# The amount of time actions should be decelerated (i.e. for demonstrations).
# TYPE: int [milliseconds]
actions.deceleration = 0

# URL of the default entry point for the application under test.
# TYPE: String [Resource URL]
# defaults.entry-point =

# Folder in which to save screenshots if not otherwise specified.
# TYPE: String [absolute or relative path to be initialized as a java.io.File instance]
folders.screenshots = screenshots

# Folder in which to save source code of pages if not otherwise specified.
# TYPE: String [absolute or relative path to be initialized as a java.io.File instance]
folders.page-sources = sourcecode

# Folder in which to save log files if not otherwise specified.
# TYPE: String [absolute or relative path to be initialized as a java.io.File instance]
folders.logs = logs

# Whether or not color highlighting of used elements should be active or not.
# TYPE: boolean [true, false]
markings.enabled = false

# Color to use for the background of used elements if color highlighting is active.
# TYPE: String [HEX RGB code starting with'#']
markings.used.background = #ffd2a5

# Color to use for the outline of used elements if color highlighting is active.
# TYPE: String [HEX RGB code starting with'#']
markings.used.outline = #916f22

# Color to use for the background of read elements if color highlighting is active.
# TYPE: String [HEX RGB code starting with'#']
markings.read.background = #90ee90

# Color to use for the outline of read elements if color highlighting is active.
# TYPE: String [HEX RGB code starting with'#']
markings.read.outline = #008000

# Default timeout for wait operations.
# TYPE: int [seconds]
wait.timeout = 2

# Default interval in which to check a condition for wait operations.
# TYPE: int [milliseconds]
wait.interval = 100

# Name of the browser to use in Selenium Grid
# TYPE: String [firefox, chrome, safari, ...]
remote.browser.name = firefox

# Version of the browser to use in Selenium Grid. If not specified, any version will be used!
# TYPE: String [eg. 46.0.1]
# remote.browser.version =

# Whether the Marionette driver (Firefox 47++) should be used.
# TYPE: boolean [true, false]
remote.firefox.marionette = true

# Host or IO address where Selenium Grid is running
# TYPE: String [localhost, 192.168.0.1, ...]
remote.host = localhost

# TYPE: Integer
