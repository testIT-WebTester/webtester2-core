# Browser Factories

A `BrowserFactory` creates an abstraction over the `Browser` initialization based on project-global settings.
They are intended to allow easy browser initialization and encapsulation of the underlying configuration / initialization
processes. Most projects implement their own factories according to their specific environment.
In case you just want to get started, we provide factories for the most common browsers:

- `ChromeFactory`
- `FirefoxFactory`
- `MarionetteFactory` (new Firefox driver)
- `InternetExplorerFactory`

All of these are provided by the `webtester-core` module, but need you to provide the corresponding Selenium `WebDriver` dependencies yourself.

## ProxyConfiguration

In order to configure a proxy you can either configure it manually when initializing the `WebDriver` or
you can implement a `ProxyConfiguration` and provide it to the `BrowserFactory` before creating a `Browser` instance.

```java
ProxyConfiguration pc = createProxyConfiguration();
Browser browser = new FirefoxFactory().withProxyConfiguration(pc).createBrowser();
```


## ChromeFactory

This `BrowserFactory` uses the `selenium-chrome-driver` to create new Chrome `Browser` instances.

### Default Driver Configuration
In order to optimize testing the following properties are set when creating a `WebDriver` using the `ChromeFactory`:

- Native events are disabled -> Selenium does not simulate human typing.
- Untrusted certificates are always accepted.

### Additional Service Executable
The 'ChromeDriver' needs an additional executable to communicate with a Chrome browser.
It can be downloaded [here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads).

The path to the executable must be declared as a system or environment property named: `webdriver.chrome.driver`

## FirefoxFactory and MarionetteFactory

These `BrowserFactory` implementations use the `selenium-firefox-driver` to create new Firefox `Browser` instances.
To drive Firefox browsers up to version 46, the `FirefoxFactory` *can* be used.
In order to drive newer versions (47++), the `MarionetteFactory` *must* be used.
The only real difference between these two factories is the activation of the `marionnette` capability.

### Default Driver Configuration
In order to optimize testing the following properties are set when creating a `WebDriver` using the `FirefoxFactory`:

- Native events are disabled -> Selenium does not simulate human typing.
- Untrusted certificates are always accepted.

### Additional Service Executable

Using the Marionette-activated `WebDriver` will force you to also specify the location of a `GeckoDriver` instance.
This is basically a proxy between Selenium and the actual Firefox (like with the `ChromeDriver`).
it can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases)

The path to the executable must be declared as a system or environment property named: `webdriver.gecko.driver`

## InternetExplorerFactory

This `BrowserFactory` uses the `selenium-ie-driver` to create new Internet Explorer `Browser` instances.

### Default Driver Configuration
In order to optimize testing the following properties are set when creating a `WebDriver` using the `InternetExplorerFactory`:

- Native events are disabled -> Selenium does not simulate human typing.
- Untrusted certificates are always accepted.

### Additional Service Executable
The `InternetExplorerDriver` needs an additional executable to communicate with a IE browser.
It can be downloaded [here](http://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/index.html).

The path to the executable must be declared as a system or environment property named: `webdriver.ie.driver`
